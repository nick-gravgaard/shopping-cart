Shopping Cart
=============

I used this exercise as an opportunity to play with scala-cli (Scala's new
default runner as of SIP-46) which seems like a perfect fit for this task.
You can install it here: https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/

How to run
----------
    scala-cli run src/ShoppingCart.scala -- apple apple orange apple

How to test

    scala-cli test .
